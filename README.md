# My Journey Learning Snowflake ☁️
*Documenting hands-on labs, key concepts, and projects from the
[Snowflake Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/snowflake-data-engineering).*

## 📘 Overview
This repo captures my progress through Snowflake’s **3-course** professional certificate.
Some SQL notebooks and scripts are **provided by Snowflake’s official labs**; others are **my own additions** (experiments, refactors, test data, and utility snippets) to mirror real-world engineering workflows.

## 🧭 Courses in the Series (3)
1. **Intro to Snowflake for Devs, Data Scientists, Data Engineers**
2. **Introduction to Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake**
3. **Advanced Data Engineering with Snowflake**

## 🎯 What You Learn (high level)
- Ingest data at scale (cloud object storage / Marketplace)  
- Transform with **SQL** and optionally **Python**  
- Deliver data products and visual insights  
- **Orchestrate data pipelines** end-to-end  
- Apply **DevOps best practices** for data pipelines  
- Implement **observability** for data pipelines

## 🧠 About the Code
- **Course-provided**: official lab SQL used as-is to practice fundamentals  
- **Custom**: my own enhancements (performance tweaks, schema variants, diagnostics, and ad-hoc checks) to deepen understanding

# snowflake-data-engeneering-coursera-professional-certificate
My journey learning Snowflake, documenting hands-on labs, key concepts, and projects from the Snowflake Data Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera.
I’m not affiliated with or paid by Snowflake or Coursera — just sharing the code, exercises, and personal takeaways from the learning process to help others exploring modern data engineering, scalability, and cloud-native design.

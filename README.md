# My Journey Learning Snowflake ☁️
*Documenting hands-on labs, key concepts, and projects from the
[Snowflake Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/snowflake-data-engineering).*

## 📘 Overview
This repo captures my progress through Snowflake’s **3-course professional certificate**.
Some SQL notebooks and scripts are **provided by Snowflake’s official labs**; others are **my own additions** (experiments, refactors, test data, and utility snippets) to mirror real-world engineering workflows.

As part of the **first course**, I extended one of the guided labs by connecting the **Tasty Cakes database** to **Power BI**, creating an interactive dashboard that visualizes sales performance, product mix, and brand trends.  
This practical addition bridges the learning from SQL-based analytics to **business intelligence reporting and visualization**.

## 🧭 Courses in the Series (3)
1. **Intro to Snowflake for Devs, Data Scientists, Data Engineers** — foundational setup and Power BI integration with the Tasty Cakes DB  
2. **Introduction to Modern Data Engineering with Snowflake** — pipelines, staging, and schema design  
3. **Advanced Data Engineering with Snowflake** — automation, orchestration, and optimization

## 🎯 What You Learn (high level)
- Ingest data at scale (cloud object storage / Marketplace)  
- Transform with **SQL** and optionally **Python**  
- Deliver **data products and visual insights** via BI tools  
- **Orchestrate data pipelines** end-to-end  
- Apply **DevOps best practices** for pipeline management  
- Implement **observability and monitoring** for data workflows

## 🧠 About the Code
- **Course-provided**: official lab SQL used as-is to practice fundamentals  
- **Custom**: my own enhancements (performance tweaks, schema variants, diagnostics, and ad-hoc checks) to deepen understanding  
- **Power BI Integration**: custom report built from the Snowflake **Tasty Cakes DB**, showcasing practical analytics and dashboard design.
